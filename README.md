# 2025-AI-Ressources

This repository contains AI resources and datasets for the 2025 TekBot Robotics Challenge, focusing on waste classification, detection, and segmentation using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

- **PDF Documents**: Educational materials on different types of waste (hazardous, household, recyclable)
- **Images**: Labeled image datasets for training AI models
- **Tutorials**: Jupyter notebooks with hands-on guides for implementing AI solutions

## Resources

### PDF Documents

- `TRC2025_Dechets_Dangereux_1.pdf`: Guide to hazardous waste identification and handling
- `TRC2025_Dechets_Menagers_1.pdf`: Information on household waste management
- `TRC2025_Dechets_Recyclables_1.pdf`: Details on recyclable materials and recycling processes

### Image Datasets

Located in the `Images/` directory, organized by waste category:

- **dangereux/**: Images of hazardous waste items (e.g., batteries, chemicals, electronics)
- **menagers/**: Images of household waste
- **recyclables/**: Images of recyclable materials

Each category contains labeled images for training classification models.

### Tutorials

Jupyter notebooks in the `Tutoriels/` directory:

- `Tuto_Apprentissage_par_renforcement_TRC_2025.ipynb`: Reinforcement learning tutorial
- `Tuto_Classification_d_images_de_déchets_TRC_2025_ipynb.ipynb`: Image classification for waste
- `Tuto_Détection_d_objets_de_déchets_avec_YOLOv8_TRC_2025.ipynb`: Object detection using YOLOv8
- `Tuto_Segmentation_TRC_2025.ipynb`: Image segmentation techniques
- `Tuto-2_Classification_d_images_de_déchets_TRC_2025.ipynb`: Advanced classification tutorial
